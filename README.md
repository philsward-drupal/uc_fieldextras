COMPATIBILITY
Drupal 7.x | Ubercart 3.x

uc_fieldextras brings a few enhancements to the Drupal Ubercart shopping cart platform.

What it does
Currently, this module adds the following functionality:

Quantity as HTML 5: Make the Ubercart Quantity field HTML5 compatible as a number instead of text on mobile to show the number pad instead of the keyboard.

Quantity +/-: Adds a plus and minus to the add-to-cart quantity form field and /cart quantity form field. It has a text field for customizing the button layout, such as adding font-awesome icons.

Quantity Autoselect: When enabled, this will force the quantity form field to select and highlight the quantity number so the user doesn't have to first delete the number.

Phone as HTML 5: Adds HTML5 functionality to the /cart/checkout phone form field to make mobile entry easier. Also includes basic number validation for US & Canada.

Email as HTML 5: Converts the /cart/checkout email form field to HTML5 and has whitespace trimming capability to remove all possibilities of a user having a whitespace in their email address which normally produces an error.

Required as HTML 5: Make all required form elements on required in a HTML5 compatible way, by adding the "required" attribute to the "input" tags, thus enabling HTML5 compatible browsers to make sure that some value has been entered into required fields.
